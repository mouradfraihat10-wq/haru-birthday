    <p>
      Happy birthday my love<br><br>
      I don’t think words can fully explain what you mean to me but I want you to know this you are one of the best things that ever happened in my life even on days when my head feels heavy and everything is confusing the thought of you brings me comfort<br><br>
      You’ve been patient with me kind to me and present even when things weren’t easy I’m grateful for that more than I can say you make my world feel softer safer and more real<br><br>
      I’m proud of you I care about you deeply and I’m thankful that you’re in my life
